    "------------------\n",
    "The database contains forms of unconstrained handwritten text, which were scanned at a resolution of 300dpi and saved as PNG images with 256 gray levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IAM Handwriting Database 3.0 is structured as follows:\n",
    "- 657 writers contributed samples of their handwriting\n",
    "- 1'539 pages of scanned text\n",
    "- 5'685 isolated and labeled sentences\n",
    "- 13'353 isolated and labeled text lines\n",
    "- 115'320 isolated and labeled words\n",
    "\n",
    "The words have been extracted from pages of scanned text using an automatic segmentation scheme and were verified manually. \n",
